.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Compact
D 2
compresses the named files using an adaptive
Huffman code.  If no file names are given,
then the standard input is compacted to
the standard output.
E 2
I 2
compresses the named files using an adaptive Huffman code.  If no file
names are given, the standard input is compacted to the standard output.
E 2
.I Compact
D 2
operates as an on-line algorithm.
Each time a byte is read,
it is encoded immediately
according to the current prefix
code.
This code is an optimal Huffman code
for the set of frequencies seen so far.
It is unnecessary to prepend a decoding
tree to the compressed file
since the encoder and the decoder
start in the same state and stay
synchronized.

The first two bytes of the

fact that the file is compacted.
This code is used to prohibit

D 2
The amount of compression
to be expected depends
on the type of file being compressed.
Typical values of compression are:
Text (38%), Pascal Source (43%),
C Source (36%) and Binary (19%).
These values are the percentages
of file bytes reduced.

.IR Compact ,
.IR uncompact ,
and
.I ccat
normally do their work silently.  If a
.B \-v
flag is supplied, 
.I compact
will report the compression percentage for each compacted
file while 
.I uncompact
and
.I ccat
will print out the name of each file as they're uncompacted.

.SH RESTRICTION
D 2
The last segment of the filename must
contain fewer than thirteen characters
E 2
I 2
D 3
The last segment of the filename must contain fewer than thirteen characters
E 3
I 3
The last segment of the filename must be short enough
E 3
E 2
to allow space for the appended '.C'.
