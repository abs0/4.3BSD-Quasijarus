/*
 * Generalized hash table ADT

/*
 * The user must supply the following:
 *
 *	1.  A comparison function which is declared as:
 *
 *		int compare(data1, data2)
 *		hash_datum *data1, *data2;
 *
 *	    This function must compare the desired fields of data1 and
 *	    data2 and return TRUE (1) if the data should be considered
 *	    equivalent (i.e. have the same key value) or FALSE (0)
 *	    otherwise.  This function is called through a pointer passed to
 *	    the various hashtable functions (thus pointers to different
 *	    functions may be passed to effect different tests on different
 *	    hash tables).
 *
 *	    Internally, all the functions of this package always call the
 *	    compare function with the "key" parameter as the first parameter,
 *	    and a full data element as the second parameter.  Thus, the key
 *	    and element arguments to functions such as hash_Lookup() may
 *	    actually be of different types and the programmer may provide a
 *	    compare function which compares the two different object types
 *	    as desired.
 *
 *	    Example:
 *
 *		int compare(key, element)
 *		char *key;
 *		struct some_complex_structure *element;
 *		{
 *		    return !strcmp(key, element->name);
 *		}
 *
 *		key = "John C. Doe"
 *		element = &some_complex_structure
 *		hash_Lookup(table, hashcode, compare, key);
 *
 *	2.  A hash function yielding an unsigned integer value to be used
 *	    as the hashcode (index into the hashtable).  Thus, the user
 *	    may hash on whatever data is desired and may use several
 *	    different hash functions for various different hash tables.
 *	    The actual hash table index will be the passed hashcode modulo
 *	    the hash table size.
 *
 *	    A generalized hash function, hash_HashFunction(), is included
 *	    with this package to make things a little easier.  It is not
 *	    guarenteed to use the best hash algorithm in existence. . . .
