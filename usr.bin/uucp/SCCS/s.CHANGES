List of Changes to UUCP
%M%	%I%	%E%
D 2
This is a list of changes made to the base version of uucp.
An attempt is made to justify the changes made.
This list may be useful to those implementing yet better versions.
	Tom Truscott
E 2

D 2
anlwrk.c: lots of changes. See the comments at the top.
	Main efficiency improvement: eliminate stat(II)s.
	Main bug fix: avoid sending files to wrong system.
E 2
I 2
Added support for Eunice.
E 2

D 2
Uses Berkeley 4.2bsd directory reading subroutines.
	Useful if someone wants to run this uucp under 4.2bsd.
E 2
I 2
Added new dialers:
	Racal Vadic 212
	Racal Vadic 811 dialer with 831 adaptor
	Racal Vadic 820 dialer with 831 adaptor
	Racal Vadic MACS, 811 dialer with 831 adaptor
	Racal Vadic MACS, 820 dialer with 831 adaptor

E 2

D 2
Added uucp subdirectories.  See 'README' or 'INSTALL' for details.
	Subdirectories are enabled by #define-ing UUDIR in uucp.h.
	No more assembler code needed.
	grep UUDIR *.[hc]  to see how it is implemented.
E 2
I 2
Running uucico with debugging on requires read access to L.sys.
E 2

D 2
Times of form 'hh:mm' are uniformly printf-ed with "%d:%02d".
	The %02d guarantees a 2 digit number w/ leading zero if needed.
E 2
I 2
If "NOSTRANGERS" is defined in uucp.h, the remote site
must be in you L.sys or the call will be rejected.
E 2

D 2
uucp work files (e.g. spool files) are created with umask==WFMASK (uucp.h).
WFMASK can disable reading by 'others'.  In fact that is the default,
which might be annoying, but you can change it.
LOG files (LOGFILE, SYSLOG, ERRLOG) are created with umask=LOGMASK (uucp.h),
which as distributed permits general read access to avoid loud user screams.
User files are created with mode (not umask!) at least BASEMODE (uucp.h)
and possibly with more permissions if the user so specified.
To avoid loud user screams, BASEMODE should probably be 666
since uucp-created files are owned by uucp.
E 2
I 2
Lock files may be kept in a subdirectory if desired.
E 2

D 2
chkpth.c: uses dynamic allocation due to Doug Kingston.
	chkpth() and chkperm() are no longer called for vanilla
	Spool area requests, so they can be made 'tougher'.
	These routines, and how they are used, is a bleak area
	of uucp that should be scrapped and redone coherently.
E 2
I 2
STST files are kept in a subdirectory.
E 2

D 2
#define for SYSIII added.  The idea is to have code that runs
on SYSIII etc. as well as v7, 32V, 4.1bsd, etc.
However it has never been tested and surely won't work.
E 2
I 2
CORRUPT subdirectory contains corrupted C. and X. files that could
not be processed. (Instead of just exiting)
E 2

D 2
cntrl.c: lots off changes here.  Mostly performance enhancements.
	Bypasses chkpth/chkperm/anyread checks for vanilla spool files.
	No longer logs 'COPY SUCCEEDED' in LOGFILE, only failures.
	(Still logs request data. And SYSLOG still logs file transfers.)
	Has 'PATIENCE' when shipping huge files (this partially works,
	the huge file gets over okay, and is signed off, but the
	next attempted transfer fails.  Not catastrophic, but not nice.)
	Cranks up a uuxqt each time ten 'X' files have gone past
	(to avoid collecting 100+ X files before uuxqt starts!)
	ultouch() is called only rarely.  A missing chmod after an 'xmv'
	has been added.  Due to the extra diligence in chkperm, etc.
	the old 'put files in /usr/spool/uucppublic' may no longer
	work "right".  Sorry, but I am not sure how it is supposed to work.
	I will look into this someday, sooner if it is an actual problem.
E 2
I 2
You can specify a maximum grade to send either on the command line (-gX)
D 3
or in the L.sys file (Any@C|Evening will only send class C [usually
E 3
I 3
or in the L.sys file (Any/C|Evening will only send class C [usually
E 3
mail] or higher during the day and will send everything in the evening)
See UUAIDS/L.sys for examples.
E 2

D 2
vectors/buffers for L.sys lines increased in versys.c and conn.c
to permit 1000 char lines and 100 'fields' on a line.
E 2
I 2
L.sys (and any of the files in lib/uucp) can contain comments by
putting a # as the first character on a line. Lines may be
continued by placing a \ as the last character of the line.
E 2

D 2
conn.c:	obscure changes here, mostly in the send/expect sequence.
	File descriptor prediction implemented (not tested!),
	extremely obscure problem apparently first noted by Steve Bellovin.
	Default end of 'send' string is \r, not \n.
	PAUSE5 pauses 5 seconds.  \d pauses 1 second (\d\d\d\d\d pauses 5).
	foo\c  sends 'foo' with no ending \r.  \05 sends control-e.
	\s sends a space (so does \40). CR sends a \r, LF sends \n.
	"" sends a \r.  Output is in even parity, changable with send strings
	P_ZERO, P_EVEN, P_ODD, P_ONE.  BREAK sends a break (or simulates one).
	And expect string of "" expects nothing, just returns, so
	to send an initial \r one can just do
		"" ""   ogin:--ogin:
	to poke the remote site into sending a login message.
	Send strings are only printed in debug if uid <= PRIV_UIDS (uucp.h).
E 2
I 2
-R flag reverses role. (Lets the remote system be master first instead
of slave)
E 2

D 2
	Alan Watt's date changes were in decvax, but should mentioned here.
	Except I am not sure how they work.  Look near the end of conn.c.
E 2
I 2
-L flag only calls "local" sites. Local sites are those sites having
one of LOCAL,TCP or DIRECT in the ACU field of L.sys.
E 2

D 2
expfile() returns 0 if the expanded file is a vanilla spool file.
	That way chkpth/chkperm can be bypassed, and those routines
	can have several huge loopholes removed.
E 2
I 2
If /etc/nologin is present (usually created by a graceful shutdown),
uucico and uuxqt will gracefully exit instead of getting killed
off when the system goes down.
E 2

D 2
gename.c has Alan Watt's (a) base 62 sequence numbering and (b)
	greatly reduced locking rate.
	The comments at the top describe it fairly well.
	It looks awful, but just use it.  It works.
E 2
I 2
Does an exponential backoff on retry time if call fails instead
of always waiting the default 5 minutes. The default may be
overridden by adding ",TIME" to the time field in L.sys. e.g.
"seismo Any,2" will use a default retry time of 2 minutes.
E 2

D 2
gio.c: ultouch() is called occasionally (kludge!)
	IO errors are checked for.
gnsys.c	calls each system only once in a uucico session.
	Also, calls callok() only once for each system.
	I forget how that works.
E 2
I 2
If uucico receives a SIGFPE while running, it will toggle debugging
on and off.
E 2

D 2
imsg.c:	strips parity bits, in case the incoming chars have some.
E 2
I 2
Better status messages provided for uustat.
E 2

D 2
logent.c:	greatly simplified!  Justs opens LOGFILE for append
	and then seeks to end and writes each new entry.
	Can cause scrambling on systems w/o guaranteed append-to-end,
	but is too good a speedup to pass up.
E 2
I 2
New program uuq to give more decriptive information on status of
jobs in uucp queue.
E 2

D 2
pk.c:	check-summing is done correctly on machines which do not
	sign-extend characters.  Time-outs made more generous.
E 2
I 2
Don't send files to remote system if it is returning out of
temp space error.
E 2

D 2
lint:	The code has been de-linted as best I could.
	uucp.h contains lots of declarations of functions which
	return non-int, like strcpy(), etc.
E 2
I 2
Correctly does the closing hangup sequence.
E 2

D 2
uucplock.c:
	ultouch() changed to be done only occasionally.
	Only changes st_ctime, not atime or mtime,
	so programs can be written to display time spent locked.
E 2
I 2
condevs.c was broken into a file for each dialer in the
directory aculib for much easier maintenance.
E 2

D 2
uucp:	uucp x foo!y  causes a uucico to call only system foo,
	not a uucico to try to call everyone with spooled work.
E 2
I 2
Only try at most TRYCALLS to dial a site instead of one try
for each dialer (lost big on systems with many dialers)
E 2

D 2
uucp.h:	unused #defines have been removed.
E 2
I 2
Add ABORT sequence to the expect/send sequence so don't have
to wait for timeout if can't get through dataswitch. e.g.
	noao Evening ACU 1200 6021234565 "" \d\r CLASS NOAOUUCP ABORT Down GO \d\r ogin:-\b-ogin: uucplogin word: uucppassword
will only call noao in the evening (evening is defined by the phone rates).
It will expect nothing and then wait 1 second (\d) and send a carriage return.
Look for CLASS, then send NOAOUUCP. From then on, if it sees the word Down
before finishing logging in, it will hang up immediately. In the mean time,
it looks for GO and if it sees it, delays 1 second and sends a CR. Looks
for ogin:, etc. This abort sequence is very useful if you must go through a 
dataswitch to get to the computer.
E 2

D 2
uulog.c:	greatly simplied, since logent.c is greatly simplied.
	Only used in forms 'uulog -u user' and 'uulog -s system'.
	Also, 'uulog -uuser' and 'uulog -ssystem' are permitted.
	And both options may be specifed. None is an error.
E 2
I 2
The time field in L.sys now handles "Evening" and "Night" in addition
to Any, Mo,Tu,We,Th,Fr,Sa,Su. Evening and Night are defined to
be when the phone rates are cheaper.
	Evening = Wk1700-0800|Sa|Su
	Night = Any2300-0800|Sa|Su0800-1700
E 2

D 2
uux:	-g<g> option added to specify priority grade.
	-c option does not copy.  -l is a synonym.
	'X' files use local system name to avoid possible name conflict.
	uucico cranked up calls only target system, not everyone.
E 2
I 2
The expect/send code now supports:
	\s	space
	\d	delay 1 second
	\r	carriage return with no linefeed
	\b	break
	\c	don't send a CR after these characters
	\xxx	the octal character xxx (e.g. \s == \040
E 2

D 2
uuxqt:	reads commands from /usr/lib/uucp/L.cmds.
	A line of form 'PATH=...' changes the command search path.
E 2
I 2
L-devices now handles "chat" scripts (like HoneyDanber) to get
through local port selectors and smart modems more easily
without mucking up every line of L.sys. See UUAIDs/L-devices for
details.
E 2

D 2
uucpname.c:	A real kludge went here.
	On some UNIX systems, a program's set-user-id bit is ignored
	if the invoker is root.  But then uucp would create files
	owned by root, and if not generally writable uucp
	would later be unable to write on them (e.g. LOGFILE).
	So uucpname, since it is called at the start of
	every relevant uucp program, checks for getuid()==geteuid()==0
	in which case it changes its uid/gid to that of the owner of
	the file /usr/lib/uucp/uucico.
E 2

I 4
The 'g'  protocol code was cleaned up a lot and is now almost

readable.
E 2

D 2
Debugging mode is permitted only to invokers with uid <= PRIV_UIDS.
E 2
I 2
If you need a parity other than even (the default) to login to
another system, you can change it in L.sys by putting in a
sequence like "" P_ZERO (expect nothing, send zero parity).
	Odd Parity	P_ODD
	Even Parity	P_EVEN
	Zero Parity	P_ZERO
	One Parity	P_ONE
E 2

D 2
dialout.c routine has dialend() routine which is called to hang up.
Tue Mar 29 16:25:01 EST 1983
E 2
I 2
If DONTCOPY is defined in uucp.h, uucp will not make a copy
of the source file by default. (This is the way System 3 does it).
E 2

D 2
Makefile: GROUP variable added so file OWNER and GROUP are both set correctly.
uuxqt/uucico/uuclean are no longer executable by 'others'.
E 2
I 2
If an X. request fails, the notification is returned to the
originator of the request instead of "uucp" on the previous
system. 
E 2

D 2
uucp.h: PRIV_UIDS reduced to 3 to reduce security danger.
E 2
I 2
The man pages are actually accurate!
E 2

D 2
cico.c: cleanup() ioctl(II)s changed to avoid hang-up on Gould/SEL machine.
E 2
I 2
If LOGBYSITE is defined, uucp logging is done with
a log file per site instead of one LOGFILE. (Like Honey DanBer does)
E 2

D 2
anlwrk.c: Infinite loop check was buggy, causing occasional,
sometimes persistent, 'NO WORK' messages.  Simpler method now used.
E 2
I 2
There is a new file (optional) L.aliases that makes life simpler when
a site changes it's name. uucp, uux, uucico, etc all check it so 
when a site is renamed (e.g convex <- parsec) all you have to do is add
an entry in L.aliases of the form:
newname oldname
E 2

D 2
conn.c: dialout() argument format changed to support variant dialers.
Also, #defines added to support different UNIX-es understanding
of different baud rates.
E 2
I 2
uucico will not try and resend files it has already sent (when the
files are specified in one C. file)
E 2

D 2
Compatibility mods:
#include <ascii.h> in dialout.c now deleted.  ncsu!mcm
	(Mike Mitchell)

System V compatibility mods.  burl!lda, Larry Auton
PATH=... in Makefile changed to APATH=... .

FIOCLEX added to prevent ACU/communication files being inherited by children.

Files cleaned up (register variables added) by Mike Mitchell (ncsu!mcm).

u[bs]_sst.c, us_rrs.c: "a+" fopen mode changed to "r+".  NOTE:
	uusub, uustat are not claimed to work in this version.
	Further, "r+" does not work in 4.1bsd or 32V.

cntrl.c calls wait(II) after uuxqt()s are started, to avoid
filling the proc table with zombies.

uuxqt now sorts "X" files to keep execution in order.

setline.c: fixes for 'system III' sites.  NOT TESTED.

gwd.c: The pwd(I) is run with effective uid reverted to the real uid.

logent also prints to stderr if debugging is on

UNET channel added.  Still running slowly, though.

Changed XQTDIR from /usr/lib/uucp/.XQTDIR to /usr/spool/uucp/XTMP.

Add gethostname().

Add SYSFILECR.

sysexits.h added
E 2
I 2
Incorporated Bill Sebok's code to dial in and out on the same modem.
I 4
NOTE: acucntrl is heavily Vax/4.xbsd specific and will require work to
run on any other system.
E 4
I 3

For compatibility with Honey DanBer, in the Date fields of L.sys,
	| was changed to , (| is supported, but not encouraged)
	, was changed to ; (to allow , to be the date seperator)

For Honey DanBer compatibility, the Grade flag is now passed as
	-vgrade=X instead of the old -pX

Don't truncate site names to 7 characters (truncate to 14 if
anyone gets that absurd) for HDB compatibility.  L.aliases may
be used to map host with longer names in L.sys to 7 character
names that some hosts send.  Entries should be 

	fullname 7-char-name
I 4

You can specify a time for the expect send sequences with ~ instead
of getting the default MAXMSGTIME. E.g.
	system Any ACU 1200 1234567 ogin~20-\r-ogin~10-\b-ogin user password pw
will look for ogin for 20 seconds, send CR, look for ogin for 10
seconds, send a BREAK and look for ogin for MAXMSGTIME seconds
I 5

Added code to support GTEs PC Pursuit service. It's mainly the handling of the
dialback they use.

Added time "NonPeak" for Tymnet/Telenet services that charge lower
rates from 6pm-7am M-F and Sat & Sun.
