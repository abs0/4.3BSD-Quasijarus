A few notes about the internals:

     The window package.  Windows are opened by calling wwopen().
Wwwrite() is the primitive for writing to windows.  Wwputc(), wwputs(),
and wwprintf() are also supported.  Some of the outputs to windows are
delayed.  Wwupdate() updates the terminal to match the internal screen
buffer.  Wwspawn() spawns a child process on the other end of a window,
D 9
with it's environment tailored to the window.  Visible windows are

visible, though wwwrite() still works.

     Most functions return -1 on error.  Wwopen() returns the null

an error message based on wwerrno suitable for printing.

     The terminal drivers perform all output to the physical terminal,
including special functions like character and line insertion and
deletion.  The window package keeps a list of known terminals.  At
initialization time, the terminal type is matched against the list to
find the right terminal driver to use.  The last driver, the generic
driver, matches all terminals and uses the termcap database.  The
interface between the window package the terminal driver is the `tt'
structure.  It contains pointers to functions to perform special
functions and terminal output, as well as flags about the
D 9
characteristics of the terminal.

from the Maryland window package, which in turn is based on Goslin's

select() returns when at least one of the pseudo-terminals becomes ready
for reading.

     Wwiomux() copies pseudo-terminal outputs into their corresponding
E 9
I 9
     Actually, wwsetjmp and wwinterrupt() are part of a software
interrupt scheme used by the two interrupt catchers wwrint() and
wwchild().  Asserting the interrupt lets the synchronous parts of
the program know that there's an interesting asynchronous condition
(i.e., got a keyboard character, or a child process died) that they
might want to process before anything else.  The synchronous routines
can check for this condition with wwinterrupt() or by arranging
that a longjmp() be done.

     Wwiomux() copies pseudo-terminal output into their corresponding
E 9
windows.  Without anything to do, it blocks in a select(), waiting for
read ready on pseudo-terminals.  Reads are done into per-window buffers
in the window structures.  When there is at least one buffer non-empty,
wwiomux() finds the top most of these windows and writes it using
D 5
wwwrite().  Then the process is repeated.  The select() blocks only when
all of the windows' buffers are empty.  The non-blocking select() is
done only to pick up any output that may have come in during the wwwrite(),
which may take a long time.  A wwupdate() is done prior to calling
a blocking select().  This is the only time the screen is guaranteed to
be completely up to date.  The pseudo-terminals run in packet mode to
control output flushing and stopping.  Wwiomux() loops until
wwinterrupt() becomes true.

wwwrite().  Then the process is repeated.  A non-blocking select() is
done after a wwwrite() to pick up any output that may have come in
during the write, which may take a long time.  Specifically, we use
this to stop output or flush buffer when a pseudo-terminal tells us to
(we use pty packet mode).  The select() blocks only when all of the
windows' buffers are empty.  A wwupdate() is done prior to this, which
is the only time the screen is guaranteed to be completely up to date.
Wwiomux() loops until wwinterrupt() becomes true.

     The top level routine for all this is mloop().  In conversation mode,
it simply calls wwiomux(), which only returns when input is available.
The input buffer is then written to the pseudo-terminal of the current
window.  If the escape character is found in the input, command mode
is entered.  Otherwise, the process is repeated.  In command mode,
control is transferred to docmd() which returns only when conversation
mode is reentered.  Docmd() and other command processing routines
typically wait for input in a loop:

     Output to the physical terminal is handled by the lowest level
routines of the window package, in the files ttoutput.c and tt.h.  The

standard IO package is not used, for better control over buffering and
to use non-blocking reads in wwrint().  The buffer size is set to

I 5
standard IO package is not used, to get better control over buffering
and to use non-blocking reads in wwrint().  The buffer size is set to
E 5
approximately one second of output time, based on the baudrate.

     The result of all this complexity is faster response time,
especially in output stopping and flushing.  Wwwrite() checks
wwinterrupt() after every line.  It also calls wwupdate() for each line
it writes.  The output buffer is limited to one second of output time.
Thus, there is usually only a delay of one to two lines plus one second
after a ^C or ^S.  Also, commands that produce lengthy output can be
aborted without actually showing all of it on the terminal.  (Try the

'h' command followed by escape immediately.)
