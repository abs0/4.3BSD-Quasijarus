.SH DESCRIPTION
Files with minor device numbers 0 through 7 refer to various portions
of drive 0;
minor devices 8 through 15 refer to drive 1, etc.
The standard device names begin with ``hp'' followed by
the drive number and then a letter a-h for partitions 0-7 respectively.
The character ? stands here for a drive number in the range 0-7.
.PP
D 2
The origin and size of the pseudo-disks on each drive are
as follows:
E 2
I 2
The block file's access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk
and the user's read or write buffer.
A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files
conventionally begin with an extra `r.'
E 2
.PP
I 2
In raw I/O counts should be a multiple of 512 bytes (a disk sector).
Likewise
.I seek
calls should specify a multiple of 512 bytes.
I 6
.PP
The first sector of each disk contains both a first-stage bootstrap program
and a disk label containing geometry information and partition layouts (see
.IR disklabel (5).
This sector is normally write-protected, and disk-to-disk copies should
avoid copying this sector.
The label may be updated with
.IR disklabel (8),
which can also be used to write-enable and write-disable the sector.
The next 15 sectors contain a second-stage bootstrap program.
E 6
.SH "DISK SUPPORT"
This driver handles both standard DEC controllers and Emulex
D 6
SC750 and SC780 controllers.  Standard DEC drive types are
recognized according to the MASSBUS drive type register.  For
the Emulex controller the drive type register should be configured
E 6
I 6
SC750 and SC780 controllers.
During autoconfiguration or whenever a drive comes on line for the first time,
as well as when a drive is opened after all partitions are closed,
the first sector of the drive is examined for a disk label.
If a label is found, the geometry of the drive and the partition tables
are taken from it.
If no label is found,
standard DEC drive types are
recognized according to the MASSBUS drive type register,
and default partitions are used.
For the Emulex controller the drive type register should be configured
E 6
to indicate the drive is an RM02.  When this is encountered,
the driver checks the holding register to find out
the disk geometry and, based on this information, decides what
the drive type is.  The following disks are supported: RM03,
RM05, RP06, RM80, RP05, RP07, ML11A, ML11B, CDC 9775, CDC 9730,

It is unwise for all of these files to be present in one installation,
since there is overlap in addresses and protection becomes
a sticky matter.
The hp?a partition is normally used for the root file system,
the hp?b partition as a paging area,
and the hp?c partition for pack-pack copying (it maps the entire disk).
D 2
On rp06's and rm03's the hp?g partition maps the rest of the pack.
On rm80's, rm05's and rp07's, both hp?g and hp?h are used to map the
remaining cylinders.

The block files access the disk via the system's normal
buffering mechanism and may be read and written without regard to
physical disk records.  There is also a `raw' interface
which provides for direct transmission between the disk

A single read or write call results in exactly one I/O operation
and therefore raw I/O is considerably more efficient when
many words are transmitted.  The names of the raw files

On disks larger than about 205 Megabytes, the hp?h partition
is inserted prior to the hp?d or hp?g partition;
