Sendmail acts a unified "post office" to which all mail can be
submitted.  Address interpretation is controlled by a production
system, which can parse both domain-based addressing and old-style
D 21
ad hoc addresses.  Mail is then dispatched to an outgoing mailer.
This system can expand trivially.  The production system is powerful

ad hoc addresses.
E 23
I 23
.i "ad hoc"
addresses.
E 23
The production system is powerful
E 21
enough to rewrite addresses in the message header to conform to the
standards of a number of common target networks, including old
(NCP/RFC733) Arpanet, new (TCP/RFC822) Arpanet, UUCP, and Phonenet.
D 21
Sendmail is not intended to perform user interface functions or
final delivery.  Sendmail also implements an SMTP server, message
E 21
I 21
Sendmail also implements an SMTP server, message
E 21
queueing, and aliasing.
D 21

This is approach is unique in that it allows external compatibility
with the old practices, and tries to make the mail system conform to
the user instead of the other way around.  Although sendmail is not
intended to circumvent new standards, it is intended to make the
transition less painful.  Sendmail does require certain base-level
standards on target mailers such as the basic semantics of certain
headers and the surface syntax of messages.  New mailers can be added
trivially; for example, a Purduenet channel was brought up in twenty
minutes.

D 20
In the early days of computer networking,
the problems of identification and communication
were quite simple by today's standards.
Each node on the network
would have an address,
and resources could be identified
E 20
I 20
In a simple network,
each node has an address,
and resources can be identified
E 20
with a host-resource pair;
in particular,
D 20
the mail system could refer to users
E 20
I 20
the mail system can refer to users
E 20
using a host-username pair.
D 20
Host names and numbers had to be administered by a central authority,
but usernames could be assigned locally to each host.
One early example is the ARPANET.
However, access to the ARPANET is limited,
and the connection cost is high.
Many alternative networks appeared,
such as the Berkeley Network,
the UUCP network,
and the CHAOS network.
Each network defined its own standards
for resource identification.

The internet was born.
.pp
Internet topology became more complex with time.
Two networks might touch
in more than one place,
and the rapid expansion of networks
created a serious database update problem.
Since all the address syntaxes were created arbitrarily,
considerable confusion reigned.
Some networks required point-to-point routing,
E 20
I 20
However,  the general case is extremely complex.
For example,
some networks require point-to-point routing,
E 20
which simplifies the database update problem
since only adjacent hosts must be entered
into the system tables,
D 20
while others used end-to-end routing.
Some networks used a left-associative syntax
and others used a right-associative syntax:
ambiguity raised its ugly head.
E 20
I 20
while others use end-to-end addressing.
Some networks use a left-associative syntax
and others use a right-associative syntax,
D 21
causing ambiguity in addresses.
E 21
I 21
causing ambiguity in mixed addresses.
E 21
E 20
.pp
D 20
Internet proposals came to the rescue.
Basically, these proposed expanding the address pairs
E 20
I 20
D 21
A new set of internet standards seek to eliminate these problems.
E 21
I 21
Internet standards seek to eliminate these problems.
E 21
Initially, these proposed expanding the address pairs
E 20
to address triples,
D 20
comprised of network-host-resource.
Network numbers would be universally agreed upon,
and hosts could be assigned in the old way
E 20
I 20
consisting of
{network, host, resource}
triples.
D 21
Network numbers can be universally agreed upon,
E 21
I 21
Network numbers must be universally agreed upon,
E 21
and hosts can be assigned locally
E 20
on each network.
D 20
But these proposals all tended to be far-reaching
and fundamentally incompatible with the old networks.
Protocols and proposals met to do battle.
And there was the issue of assigning network numbers:
there had to be a central clearing house,
and any networks that might ever touch
had to be given their very own number.
Naturally, not everyone who thought they deserved a number
got one.
E 20
I 20
D 23
The user level presentation was quickly expanded
E 23
I 23
The user-level presentation was quickly expanded
E 23
to address domains,
comprised of a local resource identification
and a hierarchical domain specification
with a common static root.
The domain technique
separates the issue of physical versus logical addressing.
For example,
an address of the form
.q "eric@a.cc.berkeley.arpa"
describes only the logical
D 21
organization of the address space,
whereas the physical structure is implied.
E 21
I 21
organization of the address space.
E 21
E 20
.pp
D 20
Which brings us to today.
Although it will be nice when everyone everywhere
has a unique network number,
it cannot be expected very soon.
The old, stupid networks take time to die,
and bureaucratic inertia is still the rule.
.pp
E 20
.i Sendmail

D 23
between the totally ad hoc world
E 23
I 23
between the totally

of networks that know nothing of each other
and the clean, tightly-coupled world

It uses old arbitrary address syntaxes
and resolves ambiguities using heuristics

who creates the configuration file.
E 20
I 20
It can accept old arbitrary address syntaxes,
resolving ambiguities using heuristics

as well as domain-based addressing.
E 20
It helps guide the conversion of message formats
between disparate networks.
In short,
.i sendmail
D 20
is glue that holds the world together
until the new world is ready to be inhabited.
I 15
However, it is not unreasonable to expect
escrow to take several years to close on this
new world.

to consistent internetwork addressing schemes.

certain sites generate incorrect from addresses

WHARTON changes our host name from

CMU puts blanks in names,

D 10
CMU also puts blanks in names,

Some hosts use blanks in names,

I 10
No attempt was made to reduce the volume of mail across a network link

E 10
Besides the difficulty of doing this,
we failed to appreciate how much volume there would be.

For example,
one of our gateways processed a message approximately
every twenty seconds

There are three ways

can communicate with the outside world,

These are using the conventional UNIX
argument vector/return status,
speaking SMTP over a pair of UNIX pipes,
and speaking SMTP over an interprocess(or) channel.
.sh 3 "Argument vector/exit status"

This technique is the standard UNIX method
for communicating with the process.
D 23
All recipients are sent in the argument vector,
and the message is sent on the standard input.
E 23
I 23
A list of recipients is sent in the argument vector,
and the message body is sent on the standard input.
E 23
Anything that the mailer prints
D 22
is simply connected and sent back to the user
E 22

D 23
is simply collected and sent back to the user
E 23
I 23
is simply collected and sent back to the sender
E 23
E 22
if there were any problems.
The exit status from the mailer is collected
after the message is sent,
and a diagnostic is printed if appropriate.
.sh 3 "SMTP over pipes"
.pp
The SMTP protocol
[Postel82]
can be used to run an interactive lock-step interface
with the mailer.
A subprocess is still created,
D 22
but no recipients are passed to the mailer.

I 22
D 23
but no recipients are passed to the mailer
E 23
I 23
but no recipient addresses are passed to the mailer

in commands sent to the processes standard input.
Anything appearing on the standard output
must be a reply code
in a special format.
.sh 3 "SMTP over an IPC connection"
.pp
D 23
This technique is almost like the previous technique,

Other macros transmit information from

examples of these are the name of the sender and the host and user
E 4

E 2
I 2
These are an ordered list of pattern-replacement rules,
D 10
somewhat like a production system,
except that order is critical.
E 2

E 2
until it resolves into a canonical address
E 10
I 10
(somewhat like a production system,
except that order is critical),
which are applied to each address.
The address is rewritten textually until it is either rewritten
into a special canonical form
E 10
(i.e.,
D 10
a [mailer, host, user]
3-tuple),
E 10
I 10
a (mailer, host, user)
3-tuple,
D 20
such as (arpanet, usc-isif, postel)

Arguments must be presented with flags before addresses.
The flags are:
.nr ii 1i
.ip "\-f addr"
The mail is from
.i addr .
This flag is ignored unless the real user
is root,
network,
or uucp,
or if
.i addr
contains an exclamation point
(because of certain restrictions in UUCP).
.ip "\-r addr"
An obsolete form of
.b \-f .
.ip "\-h cnt"
Sets the
.q "hop count"
to
.i cnt .
This represents the number of times this message has been processed
by
.i sendmail
(to the extent that it is supported by the underlying networks).
.i Cnt
is incremented during processing,
and if it reaches
MAXHOP
(currently 30)
.i sendmail
throws away the message with an error.
.ip "\-F\&name"
Sets the full name of this user to
.i name .
.ip \-e\&p
Print error messages (default).
.ip \-e\&q
Throw away error messages.
The only response is the exit status.
.ip \-e\&m
Mail back errors.
.ip \-e\&w
.q Write
back errors \*- or mail them if the user is not logged in.
.ip \-e\&e
Do special error processing for BerkNet.
This involves mailing back the errors
but always returning a zero exit status.
.ip \-n
Don't do aliasing or forwarding.
.ip \-m
Include me in alias expansions.
Normally
.i sendmail
suppresses the sender
if in a group being sent to.
.ip \-i
Don't take a dot to end a message.
.ip \-t
Read the header for
.q To: ,
.q Cc: ,
and
.q Bcc:
lines, and send to everyone listed in those lists.
The
.q Bcc:
line will be deleted before sending.
I 2

.ip \-v
Give a blow-by-blow description of function.
This gives information of interest to the user
rather than for the
.i sendmail
maintainer;
for example,
aliases are printed as expanded
and mailer functions are printed as they run.
.ip \-C\&file
Use a different configuration file.
.ip \-A\&file
Use a different alias file.
.ip \-I
Initialize the DBM version
of the alias file.
If
.b \-I
is given,
no delivery is attempted.
.ip \-V
Verify the addresses only.
Only partial verification is done:
syntax is checked, and local names are verified,
but no checking normally done by the mailer is attempted.
.ip \-d\&level
Set debugging level.
.ip \-D\&x\&val
Define macro
.i x
to have value
.i val .

Once all recipient addresses are parsed and verified,
E 23
D 21
the message is collected either from the input.
E 21
I 21
the message is collected.
E 21
The message comes in two parts:
a message header and a message body,
separated by a blank line.
.pp
The header is formatted as a series of lines
of the form
.(b
D 23
field-name: field-value
E 23
I 23
	field-name: field-value
E 23

Field-value can be split across lines by starting the following
lines with a space or a tab.
D 23
A number of header fields have special internal meaning,

I 23
Some header fields have special internal meaning,
E 23
and have appropriate special processing.
Other headers are simply passed through.
Some header fields may be added automatically,
such as time stamps.
.pp
The body is a series of text lines.
It is completely uninterpreted and untouched,
except that lines beginning with a dot
have the dot doubled
when transmitted over an SMTP channel.
D 21
This extra dot is stripped at the other end.
E 21
I 21
This extra dot is stripped by the receiver.
E 21

.sh 2 "Message Delivery"
.pp
D 20
Internally,
the recipient list is stored as one list per mailer.
Each mailer list can be scanned trivially
and mail to each host picked out to implement message batching.
E 20
I 20
The send queue is ordered by receiving host
before transmission
to implement message batching.
E 20
D 23
Each address is marked as it is sent,
so rescanning the list is safe;
this makes sending to mailers that can only accept one user easy.
E 23
I 23
Each address is marked as it is sent
so rescanning the list is safe.
E 23
An argument list is built as the scan proceeds.
Mail to files is detected during the scan of the send list.
I 20
The interface to the mailer
is performed using one of the techniques
D 21
described in the following section.
E 21
I 21
described in section 2.2.
E 21
E 20
.pp
D 20
When an argument vector is built,
E 20
I 20
D 23
After the interface is created,
E 23
I 23
After a connection is established,
E 23
E 20
.i sendmail
D 20
creates a pipe and subprocess for the mailer.
The parent calls an
.q "editing function"
which makes the per-mailer changes to the header
and sends the result to the mailer;
a different editing function is used for sending error messages
which prepends the error information.
.pp
The exit status from the mailer is collected
after the message is sent,
and a diagnostic is printed if appropriate.
E 20
I 20
makes the per-mailer changes to the header
and sends the result to the mailer.
E 20
If any mail is rejected by the mailer,
a flag is set to invoke the return-to-sender function
after all delivery completes.
E 8
D 20
.sh 2 "Exit Status"
.pp
D 14
An exit status is returned that corresponds to the system standard
used by the other mailers.
E 14
I 14
.i Sendmail
defines a set of standard exit status codes
that should be returned by mailers.
These are in turn returned by
.i sendmail .

D 23
If the mailer gave a

I 23
If the mailer returns a
E 23
.q "temporary failure"
exit status,
the message is queued.
A control file is used to describe the recipients to be sent to
and various other parameters.
E 13
I 2
D 20
.sh 2 "Interaction With Other Mailers"
E 20
I 20
This control file is formatted as a series of lines,
each describing a sender,
a recipient,
the time of submission,
or some other salient parameter of the message.
The header of the message is stored
in the control file,
so that the associated data file in the queue
is just the temporary file that was originally collected.
D 24
.sh 2 "Examples of Interactions With Other Mailers"
E 20
.pp
Two examples of how network-specific work is passed to other programs
are the incoming UUCP mailer
(\c
.i rmail )
and the outgoing ARPANET mailer.
.sh 3 "Incoming UUCP mail"
.pp
Mail coming in from the UUCP network
is not guaranteed to have a normal header line,
D 4
nor will at argument be passed telling who it is from\**.
E 4
I 4
nor will an argument be passed telling who it is from\**.

\**As a result of this,
E 23
I 23
\**As a result,
E 23
it is impossible to verify UUCP sender addresses.
.)f
Fortuitously,
UUCP mail calls the program
.i rmail
rather than
.i mail
or
.i sendmail .
The
.i rmail
D 23
program has been modified here to do the special-purpose parsing
E 23
I 23
program has been modified to do the special-purpose parsing
E 23
necessary to decode UUCP headers
and turn them into a normal UUCP address;
this address is then passed to
D 8
.i sendmail
via a
.b \-f
flag.
E 8
I 8
.i sendmail .
E 8
.sh 3 "Outgoing ARPANET mail"
.pp
The ARPANET imposes many standards that
.i sendmail
does not care to enforce.
For example,
an arpanet sitename must be on
.i every
address,
not just the
.q "From:"
address.
Certain UNIX sites like to use
.q %
as an alternative to
.q @ ,
which must be translated.
D 3
The outgoing ARPANET mailer makes these tranformations
E 3
I 3
The outgoing ARPANET mailer makes these transformations

before passing the message to the network.

E 10
I 10
Adding mailers or changing parsing
(i.e., rewriting)
or routing information
E 10
does not require recompilation.
.pp
If the mail is being sent by a local user,
and the file
.q .mailcf
exists in the sender's home directory,
that file is read as a configuration file
after the system configuration file.
D 23
The primary use of this is to add header lines.
E 23
I 23
The primary use of this feature is to add header lines.
E 23
I 22
.pp
The configuration file encodes macro definitions,
header definitions,
mailer definitions,
rewriting rules,
and options.
.sh 3 Macros
.pp
Macros can be used in three ways.
Certain macros transmit
unstructured textual information
into the mail system,
such as the name
.i sendmail
will use to identify itself in error messages.
Other macros transmit information from
.i sendmail
to the configuration file
for use in creating other fields
(such as argument vectors to mailers);
e.g., the name of the sender,
and the host and user
of the recipient.
Other macros are unused internally,
and can be used as shorthand in the configuration file.
.sh 3 "Header declarations"
.pp
Header declarations inform
.i sendmail
of the format of known header lines.
Knowledge of a few header lines
is built into
.i sendmail ,
such as the
.q From:
and
.q Date:
lines.
.pp
Most configured headers
will be automatically inserted
in the outgoing message
if they don't exist in the incoming message.
Certain headers are suppressed by some mailers.
.sh 3 "Mailer declarations"
.pp
Mailer declarations tell
.i sendmail
of the various mailers available to it.
The definition specifies the internal name of the mailer,
the pathname of the program to call,
some flags associated with the mailer,
and an argument vector to be used on the call;
D 23
this vector is macro expanded before use.
E 23
I 23
this vector is macro-expanded before use.
E 23
.sh 3 "Address rewriting rules"
.pp
The heart of address parsing in
.i sendmail
is a set of rewriting rules.
These are an ordered list of pattern-replacement rules,
(somewhat like a production system,
except that order is critical),
which are applied to each address.
The address is rewritten textually until it is either rewritten
into a special canonical form
(i.e.,
a (mailer, host, user)
3-tuple,
such as {arpanet, usc-isif, postel}
representing the address
.q "postel@usc-isif" ),
or it falls off the end.
When a pattern matches,
the rule is reapplied until it fails.
.pp
The configuration file also supports the editing of addresses
into different formats.
For example,
an address of the form:
.(b
ucsfcgl!tef
.)b
might be mapped into:
.(b
tef@ucsfcgl.UUCP
.)b
to conform to the domain syntax.
Translations can also be done in the other direction.
.sh 3 "Option setting"
.pp
D 23
There are a number of options that can be set
E 23
I 23
There are several options that can be set
E 23
from the configuration file.
These include the pathnames of various support files,
timeouts,
default modes,
etc.
E 22
I 14
D 20
This could also be used to adjust the full name by
defining the
.b x
macro; e.g.,
.(b
DxEric Allman in Outer Space
.)b
E 14
.sh 2 "Configuration File Description"
.pp
The configuration file is formatted
as a series of text lines,
each beginning with a character describing its semantics.
Blank lines and lines beginning with a sharp sign
(#)
are ignored.
I 2
Other lines are:
.(b

This line defines a macro
with the single character name
.i x
and value
.i val .
Macros can be interpolated using the escape
.b $ \c
E 4
.i x ,
where
.i x
is the macro name.
By convention,
all upper-case letters are unused by
.i sendmail
and may be used freely by the user;
all other names are reserved for use by sendmail.
Certain macros
.i must
be defined,
and are used internally.
These are:

E 3
$l	UNIX-style \*(lqFrom\*(rq line.
$n	My address in error messages.
$o	\*(lqOperators\*(rq in addresses.
I 16
$q	How to write addresses in headers.
E 16
.)b
The
.b $l
macro is expanded when
.i sendmail
wants to insert a UNIX-style
.q From
line on messages.
This typically expands to something like:
.(b
D 4
From joe  Wed Aug 12 09:15:13 1981
E 4
I 4
From sally  Wed Aug 12 09:15:13 1981
E 4
.)b
The
.b $n
macro is used as the name of this process
when error messages are being mailed back.
Typically,
it is wise to include an alias
so that mail to this address will be sent to root.
The
.b $o
macro defines the characters
that will separate words when addresses are being broken up.
Each of these becomes a word by itself when scanned.
Blanks and tabs are built-in separators
but are ignored,
i.e., are not turned into words.
For example, the input:
.(b
D 4
Ing70:ZRM @ MIT-MC SRI-KL
E 4
I 4
Ing70:  ZRM  @  MIT-MC  SRI-KL
E 4
.)b
Is broken up into the six words:
.(b
Ing70, :, ZRM, @, MIT-MC, SRI-KL
.)b
assuming that colon and at-sign are operators
(but hyphen is not).
I 16
The
.b $q
macro gives the format for addresses
as they should appear in headers.
This will normally be something like:
.(b
$g$?x ($x)$.
.)b
Which will give the translated from address
followed by the full name if known.
E 16

$b	The current date in ARPANET format.
E 4
$c	The hop count.
$d	The date in UNIX (ctime) format.
$f	The sender's (from) address.
$g	The sender's address translated by the mailer.
$h	The host of the recipient.
$p	The process id of sendmail in decimal.
$t	The time in seconds in decimal.
$u	The user part of the recipient.
$v	The version number of sendmail.
$x	The full name of the sender.
$y	The id of the sender's terminal.
$z	The home directory of the recipient.

.b $a
E 4
and
D 4
.b $t

E 4
I 4
.b $b
macros are in ARPANET format;
.b $a
is a copy of the time extracted from the
.q Date:
field of the incoming message
(if there was one),
and
.b $b
is the current date and time \*- used for postmarks.
If no
.q Date:
is found in the message,
they are the same.
E 4
The
I 4
.b $d
macro has the date in UNIX
.i ctime
format;
this is extracted from the message if possible
and is otherwise the current date.
.pp
The
E 4
.b $f
macro is the id of the sender
as originally determined;
when mailing to a specific person,
the
.b $g
macro is the address of the sender
with respect to the receiver.
For example,
if I send to
.q csvax:samwise
the
.b $f
and
.b $g
macros are:
.(b
I 3
.ta 4n
E 3

this value is taken as the full name.
E 8
I 8
It can be passed as a flag to

E 8
The
.q Full-Name:
line in the header is the second option,

line is the third.
If all of these fail,
and if the message is being originated locally,
the full name is looked up in the

E 2
When sending, the
.b $u ,
.b $h ,
and
.b $z
macros get set to the user, host, and home directory
(respectively)
of the receiver.
The host is only set if the user is not local,
and the home directory is only set if the user is local.
.pp
I 4
The
.b $p
and
.b $t
macros are used to create unique strings.
The
.b $y
macro is set to the id of the terminal of the sender
(if known);
some systems like to put this in the
.q From
line.
The
.b $v
macro is set to the version number of
.i sendmail ,
and can be used in postmarks
to help debugging.

All headers mentioned in this way

These headers are

To get these fields the appropriate flag
must be specified

Since the file

it is possible to add customized header lines.
For example,

The internal name of the mailer,
referred to in the rewriting rules.

The pathname of the program to execute for this mailer.
.np
The flags for this mailer,
described below.
.np
The macro string to become the
.b $g
macro (translated sender)
for this mailer.
.np
The argument vector passed to the mailer
(macro expanded).
.pp
The flags are a series of characters:
.ls 1
.ip f
The mailer wants a
.b \-f
.i from
flag,
but only if this is a network forward operation
(i.e.,
the mailer will give an error
if the executing user does not have special permissions).
.ip r
Same as
.b f ,
but sends a
.b \-r
flag.
.ip q
Don't print errors \*- the mailer will do it for us.
.ip S
Don't reset your userid before calling the mailer.
This would be used in a secure environment where
.i sendmail
ran as a special user.
This could be used to prevent
(or at least complicate)
forged addresses.

E 8
option, or in the
.i \&.mailcf
file in the home directory).
E 2
.ip n
This mailer does not want a UNIX-style
.q From
line on the message.
.ip l
This mailer is local,
so no host will be specified.
I 4
Also,
the mailer wants special local processing
(such as a
.q Received-Date:
field).
E 4
.ip s
Strip quote characters off of addresses
before calling the mailer.
.ip m
This mailer can send to multiple users
(on the same host)
in one call.
.ip F
This mailer wants a
.q From:
header line.
.ip D
This mailer wants a
.q Date:
header line.
.ip M
This mailer wants a
.q Message-Id:
header line.
.ip x
This mailer wants a
.q Full-Name:
header line.
.ip u
Upper case should be preserved in user names.
.ip h
Upper case should be preserved in host names.
I 16
.ip e
This mailer is expensive,
and it may be desirable to limit usage.
I 18
.ip R
The recipient addresses should be rewritten to be relative to the
receiver, rather than relative to the sender.
This is always done with sender addresses,
but should only be done on recipients
if the host you are sending to knows that it is being done.
Setting this flag makes it easy to do a
.q reply
command in a user mail program
(since all that must be done is send to all addresses in the message header),
but user mail programs that try to rewrite the addresses
will be completely confused.
E 18
E 16
.ip A
This mailer wants an ARPANET standard header
(equivalent to the
.b F
and
.b D
flags).
I 14
.ip U
This mailer is a UUCP mailer that wants leading from lines
of the form:
.(b
From sender <date> remote from sysname
.)b
instead of the more reasonable:
.(b
From sysname!sender <date>
.)b
A compilation flag must be on to include this code.
E 14
.ls
I 14
.lp
There should always be at least one flag,
since every message should include either a

There are two sets of rewriting rules.
E 11
I 11
There are three sets of rewriting rules.
E 11
Set zero is used to rewrite recipient addresses.
Set one is used to rewrite sender addresses.
I 11
Set two is applied after evaluating the
.q $g
macro,
i.e., after determining the from address for a particular mailer.
.pp
E 11
Set one can be used to eliminate implicit links.
For example,
if there exists a site on on the BerkNet called
.q Ing70
which is an ARPANET gateway,
and we are on a site called
.q IngVAX ,
ARPANET mail coming into
.q Ing70
for someone on
.q IngVAX
will read:
.(b
From: Ing70:auser@ahost
.)b
Rewriting set one can rewrite this as:
.(b
From: auser@ahost
.)b
since
.q Ing70
will be implied.
I 11
.pp
Set two is used to eliminate anomalies resulting from
forwarding.
For example,
a message received at Ing70 from mckusick on the CSVAX will
appear as:
.(b
From CSVAX:mckusick
.)b
If this is then forwarded to IngVAX,
sendmail on Ing70 will rewrite the from address as:
.(b
From Ing70:CSVAX:mckusick
.)b
The extra host reference can be eliminated by ruleset two on Ing70.
E 11
.pp
When you change to a new set,
the previous content of that set is cleared.

E 4
I 4
The rewriting rules drive the address parser.
The rewriting process is essentially textual.
E 4
First,
the address to be rewritten is broken up into words.
Words are defined as strings of non-special characters
separated by white space or single special characters
as defined by the
.b $o
macro.
Then,
the words are rewritten using simple pattern matching.
Words in the pattern match themselves
unless they begin with dollar sign.
The dollar escapes have the following meanings\**:

The case of letters is ignored in pattern matching
(including class comparisons).

When a pattern (also called a left hand side or LHS)
matches,
the input is rewritten as defined by the right hand side (RHS).
Acceptable escapes in the RHS are:

As soon as the input resolves to a canonical name,
matching ends;
E 4
I 4
.q "$#mailer$@host$:user" ),
rewriting ends;
E 4
otherwise,
the next pattern is tried.
The
.q "$@host"
part is not needed
if the mailer does not require a host.
The special mailer
.q error
causes the user part to be printed as an error.

There are twenty six word classes,
represented as

For example:
.(b

defines the words

features eliminate the requirement that the system alias file
E 4

.np
.i Sendmail
supports message batching across networks
when a message is being sent to multiple recipients.
I 24
.np
A mail queue is provided in
.i sendmail.
Mail that cannot be delivered immediately
but can potentially be delivered later
is stored in this queue for a later retry.
The queue also provides a buffer against system crashes;
after the message has been collected
it may be reliably redelivered
even if the system crashes during the initial delivery.
.np
.i Sendmail
uses the networking support provided by 4.2BSD
to provide a direct interface networks such as the ARPANET
and/or Ethernet

over a TCP/IP connection.

However,
like MMDF,
the MPM includes the network interface software

MPM also postulates a duplex channel to the receiver,

Interfacing to mail programs

in an internet environment
has been amazingly successful,

.pp
D 13
However,
many of these mailers implement their own queueing and retransmission.
In networks that support store-and-forward file transfer,
such as BerkNet and UUCP,
this feature must be supplied already.
However,
networks that transfer in real time,

both highly desirable features\**.

The decision to avoid doing any type of delivery where possible
(even, or perhaps especially, local delivery)
has turned out to be a good idea.
Even with local delivery,
there are issues of the location of the mailbox,
the format of the mailbox,
the locking protocol used,
etc.,
that are best decided by other programs.
One surprisingly major annoyance in many internet mailers
is that the location and format of local mail is built in.
The feeling seems to be that local mail is so common
that it should be efficient.

The ability to automatically generate a response to incoming mail

A more palatable technique for giving error messages

Some proposals call for a single address syntax,
such that the host name uniquely determines the network.
There are a number of evident problems with this.
In a large internet,
the database update problem becomes considerable,
especially under multiple managements;
this can be solved by a daemon that updates the tables
dynamically,
but it is not clear what the problems are here.
More to the point,
this requires a unique namespace among all networks.
In our current configuration
we have been unable to even find out the names of all the hosts
on the UUCP network;
to hope that on an internet with fifty or more networks
would have no name conflicts is beyond the scope of
.i sendmail .
Despite the difficulties, however,
this is probably a better long-term solution to the problem
of internet addressing.
The ambiguities implied by addresses combining
left-associative and right-associative addresses
are impossible to solve without parentheses;
acceptable for mathematical equations,
but absurd for network addresses.

A related problem occurs with the user namespace.

.++ A
.+c "SENDMAIL USAGE"
.pp
Arguments must be presented with flags before addresses.
The flags are:
.nr ii 1i
.ip "\-f addr"
D 4
The mail is from
E 4
I 4
The sender's machine address is
E 4
.i addr .
This flag is ignored unless the real user
is root,
network,
or uucp,
or if
.i addr
contains an exclamation point
(because of certain restrictions in UUCP).
.ip "\-r addr"
An obsolete form of
.b \-f .
.ip "\-h cnt"
Sets the
.q "hop count"
to
.i cnt .
This represents the number of times this message has been processed
by
.i sendmail
(to the extent that it is supported by the underlying networks).
.i Cnt
is incremented during processing,
and if it reaches
MAXHOP
(currently 30)
.i sendmail
throws away the message with an error.
.ip "\-F\&name"
Sets the full name of this user to
.i name .
.ip \-e\&p
Print error messages (default).
.ip \-e\&q
Throw away error messages.
The only response is the exit status.
.ip \-e\&m
Mail back errors.
.ip \-e\&w
.q Write
back errors \*- or mail them if the user is not logged in.
.ip \-e\&e
Do special error processing for BerkNet.
This involves mailing back the errors
but always returning a zero exit status.
.ip \-n
Don't do aliasing or forwarding.
.ip \-m
Include me in alias expansions.
Normally
.i sendmail
suppresses the sender
if in a group being sent to.
I 16
.ip \-o
D 17
Assume that header lines containing recepient names in the message
will have addresses separated by spaces
rather than by commas.
E 17
I 17
Assume that the headers are already in new format,
i.e.,
there are commas between names and spaces are to be preserved.
If this flag is not given,
an adaptive algorithm is used:
if any recipient address contains a comma, parenthesis,
or angle bracket,
it will be assumed that commas already exist.
This flag is required in certain rare cases.
E 17
Headers are always output with commas between the names.
E 16
.ip \-i
Don't take a dot to end a message.
.ip \-t
Read the header for
.q To: ,
.q Cc: ,
and
.q Bcc:
lines, and send to everyone listed in those lists.
The
.q Bcc:
line will be deleted before sending.
Any addresses in the argument vector will be deleted
from the send list.
D 13
.ip \-a\&m
E 13
I 13
.ip \-a
E 13
Do special processing for the
ARPANET.
D 4
This includes taking the
E 4
I 4
This includes reading the
E 4
.q "From:"
D 4
person from the header,
E 4
I 4
line from the header to find the sender,
E 4
printing
ARPANET
style messages
(preceded by three digit reply codes for compatibility with
the FTP protocol
D 5
[Neigus78, FTP2, Postel77]),
E 5
I 5
[Neigus73, Postel74, Postel77]),
E 5
D 4
and ending lines with <CRLF>.
E 4
I 4
and ending lines of error messages with <CRLF>.
E 4
D 13
.ip \-a\&f
Same as
.b \-a\&m ,
except print out message numbers appropriate for the MLFL command
[Postel77].
E 13
I 13
D 16
.ip \-a\&p
E 16
I 16
.ip \-a\&s
E 16
Take input over an SMTP connection on standard input and output.
This does everything the \-a flag does also.
E 13
.ip \-s
Save UNIX-style
.q From
lines at the beginning of headers.
Normally they are assumed redundant
and discarded.
.ip \-v
Give a blow-by-blow description of function.
This gives information of interest to the user
rather than for the
.i sendmail
maintainer;
for example,
aliases are printed as expanded
and mailer functions are printed as they run.
I 16
.ip \-c
If this mailer is marked as being expensive,
don't connect immediately.
This requires that queueing be compiled in,
since it will depend on a sender process to
actually send the mail.
E 16
I 13
D 17
.ip \-q
E 17
I 17
.ip \-q\&time
E 17
Try to execute the queued up mail.
I 17
If the time is given,
a sendmail will run through the queue at the specified interval
to deliver queued mail;
otherwise, it only runs once.
E 17
I 15
.ip \-p
Verify as much about the addresses and message as possible
and then politely run in background.
E 15
.ip \-D
Run as a daemon.
D 17
This automatically runs SMTP.
This is not completely supported yet.
E 17
I 17
This should always be used with the
.b \-as
flag,
as it runs on the SMTP port.
E 17
.ip \-T\&time
Set timeout interval for mail that cannot be sent.
.ip \-Q\&dir
Select directory in which mail will be queued.
Typically for debugging only.
E 13
.ip \-C\&file
Use a different configuration file.
.ip \-A\&file
Use a different alias file.
.ip \-I
Initialize the DBM version
of the alias file.
If
.b \-I
is given,
no delivery is attempted.
I 8
The DBM version will be rebuilt automatically if the DBM files
are mode 666,
or if they are owned by the effective userid.
E 8
.ip \-V
Verify the addresses only.
Only partial verification is done:
syntax is checked, and local names are verified,
but no checking normally done by the mailer is attempted.
.ip \-d\&level
Set debugging level.
D 13
.ip \-D\&x\&val
E 13
I 13
.ip \-M\&x\&val
E 13
Define macro
.i x
to have value
.i val .
.nr ii 5n
.+c "OTHER CONFIGURATION"
.pp
There are some configuration changes that can be made by
recompiling
.i sendmail .
Some of these are changes to compilation flags:
.nr ii 1i
.ip V6
If set,
this will compile a version 6 system,
with 8-bit user id's,
single character tty id's,
etc.
If not set,
a version 7 system is assumed.
.ip DBM
If set,
the
.q DBM
package in UNIX is used
(see DBM(3X) in [UNIX80]).
If not set,
a much less efficient algorithm for processing aliases is used.
.ip VFORK
Set if your system has the experimental
.i vfork
system call.
See vfork(2) in [UNIX80].
If not set,
the regular
.i fork
system call is used.
This option improves performance.
.ip DEBUG
If set, debugging information is compiled in.
To actually get the debugging output,
the
.b \-d
flag must be used.
.ip LOG
If set,
the
.i syslog
D 14
routine in use at some Berkeley sites is used.
This logs an informational log record
E 14
I 14
routine in use at some sites is used.
This makes an informational log record
E 14
for each message processed,
D 4
and logs a higher-priority log record
E 4
I 4
D 14
and logs a higher priority log record
E 14
I 14
and makes a higher priority log record
E 14
E 4
for internal system errors.
D 13
.ip NEWFTP
If set, the ARPANET reply codes for
D 4
.q "Revised New FTP" are used
E 4
I 4
.q "Revised New FTP"
are used
E 4
D 5
[FTP2].
E 5
I 5
[Postel74].
E 5
If not set,
reply codes for the old, unrevised
.q "New FTP"
are used
D 5
[Neigus78].
E 5
I 5
[Neigus73].
E 5
If you want to use reply codes for the Mail Transfer Protocol
[Sluizer81]
you may find it necessary to make some code modifications.
E 13
I 13
.ip QUEUE
This flag should be set to compile in the queueing code.
If this is not set,
mailers must accept the mail immediately
or it will be returned to the sender.
.ip SMTP
If set,
the code to handle user and server SMTP will be compiled in.
This is only necessary if your machine has some mailer
that speaks SMTP.
.ip UGLYUUCP
If you have a UUCP host adjacent to you which is not running
a reasonable version of
.i rmail ,
you will have to set this flag to include the
.q "remote from sysname"
info on the from line.
Otherwise, UUCP gets confused about where the mail came from.
E 13
.ip PARANOID
There are places where
.i sendmail
may opt for a more secure,
but probably less convenient environment.
For example,
if this flag is set
it is not possible to specify a program as an address directly;
this can only be done with an alias.
I 7
.ip NOTUNIX
If you are using a non-UNIX mail format,
you can set this flag to turn off special processing
of UNIX-style
.q "From "
lines.
E 7
.nr ii 5n
.pp
D 14
If you want to enable special processing of other headers,
you will have to add them to the
E 14
I 14
Not all header semantics are defined in the configuration file.
Header lines that should only be included by certain mailers
(as well as other more obscure semantics)
must be specified in the
E 14
.i HdrInfo
table in
.i conf.c .
This table contains the header name
(which should be in all lower case),
a set of header control flags (described below),
and a set of mailer flags,
used by some of the header flags.
The header flags are:
D 4
.nr ip 1.2i
E 4
I 4
.nr ii \w'H_ACHECK  'u
E 4
.ip H_CHECK
Check the flags for the receiving mailer
against the third field in the
.i HdrInfo
entry.
If the mailer has any of those bits set,
send this field;
otherwise, do not send this field to that mailer.
If the field was in the message originally, however,
it will always be sent
(i.e., this only applies to headers being added by
.i sendmail ).
.ip H_ACHECK
Same as H_CHECK,
except that it even applies to headers that were in the
original message.
That is,
if this bit is set and the mailer does not have flag bits set
that intersect with the third field in this
.i HdrInfo
entry,
the header line is
.i always
deleted.
.ip H_EOH
If this header field is set,
treat it like a blank line,
i.e.,
it will signal the end of the header
and the beginning of the message text.
.ip H_FORCE
Add this header entry
even if one existed in the message before.
If a header entry does not have this bit set,
.i sendmail
will not add another header line if a header line
of this name already existed.
This would normally be used to stamp the message
by everyone who handled it.
D 16
.ip H_ADDR
E 16
I 16
.ip H_RCPT
E 16
If set,
this field contains recipient addresses.
This is used by the
.b \-t
flag to determine who to send to
when it is collecting recipients from the message.
I 16
.ip H_ADDR
This flag indicates that this field
contains addresses that should be rewritten
to include commas, etc.
E 16
.nr ii 5n
.lp
Let's look at a sample
.i HdrInfo
specification:
.(b
.sz -2
D 4
.ta 4n +\w'"original-from",  'u +\w'H_ADDR|H_ACHECK,  'u
E 4
I 4

E 4
struct hdrinfo	HdrInfo[] =
{
	"date",	H_CHECK,	M_NEEDDATE,
	"from",	H_CHECK,	M_NEEDFROM,
	"original-from",	H_ACHECK,	0,
	"sender",	0,	0,
	"full-name",	H_ACHECK,	M_FULLNAME,
	"to",	H_ADDR,	0,
	"cc",	H_ADDR,	0,

	"received-from",	H_CHECK,	M_LOCAL,
	"via",	H_FORCE,	0,
	NULL,	0,	0,
};
.sz
.)b
This specification says that the
.q Date: ,
.q From: ,
.q Message-Id: ,
.q Received-Date: ,
and
.q Received-From:
must be requested by the mailer to be inserted.
However,
if they were in the message as received by
.i sendmail
they will be propagated.
The
.q Full-Name:
field, on the other hand,
will be deleted even if it was specified before,
unless the mailer wants it.
The
.q Original-From:
and
.q Bcc:
fields will be deleted unconditionally
D 4
(since it is never possible for a mailers flags
E 4
I 4
(since it is never possible for a mailer's flags
E 4
to intersect with zero).
The
.q Original-From:
is in fact used internally,
and will be reinserted by ad hoc code,
but only if it differs from the
.q From:
line that would otherwise be inserted.
.q To: ,
.q Cc: ,
and
.q Bcc:
all specify recipient addresses.
The
.q Message:
and
.q Text:
fields will terminate the header;
these are specified in new protocols
[NBS80]
or used by random dissenters around the network world.
The
.q Via:
field will always be added,
and can be used to trace messages.
The
.q Sender:
field is used internally,
although no cliched special processing occurs.
.pp
There are a number of important points here.
First,
header fields are not added automatically just because they are in the
.i HdrInfo
structure;
D 4
they must be specified in the configuration file.
E 4
I 4
they must be specified in the configuration file
in order to be added to the message.
E 4
Any header fields mentioned in the configuration file but not
mentioned in the
.i HdrInfo
structure have default processing performed;
that is,
they are added unless they were in the message already.
Second,
the
.i HdrInfo
structure only specifies cliched processing;
certain headers are processed specially by ad hoc code
regardless of the status specified in
.i HdrInfo .
For example,
the
.q Sender:
and
.q From:
fields are always scanned on ARPANET mail
to determine the sender;
this is used to perform the
.q "return to sender"
function.
The
.q "From:"
and
.q "Full-Name:"
fields are used to determine the full name of the sender
if possible;
this is stored in the macro
.b $x
and used in a number of ways.
Although the
.q "Original-From:"
field is specified to be deleted in
.i HdrInfo ,
it is added automatically if the
.q From:
field that would be generated internally
differs from the
.q From:
field that was specified in the message;
in this case,
the original
.q From:
field is renamed
.q Original-From: .
.pp
The file
.i conf.c
also contains the specification of ARPANET reply codes.
There are six classifications these fall into:
.(b
.sz -2
D 5
.ta \w'char  'u +\w'Arpa_Usrerr[] =  'u +\w'"999";  'u
E 5
I 5
.ta \w'char  'u +\w'Arpa_Usrerr[] =  'u +\w'"888";  'u
E 5
char	Arpa_Info[] =	"050";	/* arbitrary info */
char	Arpa_Enter[] =	"350";	/* start mail input */
char	Arpa_Mmsg[] =	"256";	/* mail successful (MAIL cmd) */
char	Arpa_Fmsg[] =	"250";	/* mail successful (MLFL cmd) */
char	Arpa_Syserr[] =	"455";	/* some (transient) system error */
char	Arpa_Usrerr[] =	"450";	/* some (fatal) user error */
.sz
.)b
The class
.i Arpa_Info
is for any information that is not required by the protocol,
such as forwarding information.
.i Arpa_Enter
is output when
.i sendmail
wants to start receiving the mail.
.i Arpa_Mmsg
and
.i Arpa_Fmsg
are given if the mail is successfully delivered;
D 4
the selection of message number depends on the command given
E 4
I 4
the selection of message number depends on the FTP command given
E 4
(which is communicated via the
.b \-a
flag).
.i Arpa_Syserr
is printed by the
.i syserr
routine;
typically, this occurs when something has gone wrong at the
receiving site,
with the assumption that it is a transient condition.
Finally,
.i Arpa_Usrerr
is the result of a user error
and is generated by the
.i usrerr
routine;
these are generated when the user has specified something wrong,
and hence the error is permanent,
i.e.,
it will not work simply by resubmitting the request.
.pp
If it is necessary to restrict mail through a gateway,
the
.i checkcompat
routine can be modified.
This routine is called for every recipient address.
It can return
.b TRUE
to indicate that the address is acceptable
and mail processing will continue,
or it can return
.b FALSE
to reject the recipient.
If it returns false,
it is up to
.i checkcompat
to print an error message
(using
.i usrerr )
saying why the message is rejected.
For example,
.i checkcompat
could read:
.(b
.re
.sz -2
bool
checkcompat(to)
	register ADDRESS *to;
{
	if (MsgSize > 50000 && to->q_mailer != MN_LOCAL)
	{
		usrerr("Message too large for non-local delivery");
		return (FALSE);
	}
	return (TRUE);
}
.sz
.)b
This would reject messages greater than 50000 bytes
unless they were local.
The actual use of this routine is highly dependent on the
implementation,
and use should be limited.
