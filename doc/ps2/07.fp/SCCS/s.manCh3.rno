.NS 1 "Getting on and off the System"
.sp
.pp
Startup FP from the shell by entering the command:
.sp
.ce
.b "/usr/local/fp".
.sp
.pp
The system will prompt you for input by indenting over six character
positions.
Exit from FP (back to the shell) with a  control/D (\fB^D\fP).
.NS 2 "Comments"
.pp
A user may end any line (including a command) with a comment;
the comment character is '#'.  The
interpreter will ignore any character after the '#' until it encounters
a  newline character or end-of-file, whichever comes first.
.sp 4p
.NS 2 "Breaks"
.pp
Breaks interrupt any work in progress causing the system
to do a \s-2FRANZ\s+2 reset before returning control back to the user.
.sp 4p
.NS 2 "Non-Termination"
.pp
LISP's namestack may,
on occasion,
overflow.
FP responds by printing \*(lqnon-terminating\*(rq and
returning  bottom as the result of the application.  It does a 
\s-2FRANZ\s+2 reset before returning control to
the user.
