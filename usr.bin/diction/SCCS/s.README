c Bill Jolitz @ Berkeley received this version from Lorindia Cherry
c around September 1981, as the ``most recent version''.  Deltas 
c seem to be progressive, rather than regressive, although the BTL sid for
c deroff.c is retrograde; this is probably a case of parallel development

The writing tools package contains 3 command files,

``style'' reads a document and analyzes the surface
	characteristics of the writing style of the document.
``diction'' locates all sentences in a document containing
	commonly misused or wordy phrases.
D 2
``explain'' is an interactive thesaures for the phrases found by diction.

``suggest'' is an interactive thesaures for the phrases found by diction.

``style'' is a runcom that runs 4 programs, style1, style2, style3, and deroff.
D 2
	style1, style2, style3 are included on the tape, you should not need to
	make them, but if you do -
E 2

D 2
To make style1, style2, style3:
	set BIN in Makefile to the directory where the object files
		are to be stored.
E 2
I 2
To make style:
	set LIB in Makefile to the directory where the object files
		are to be stored. (probably /usr/lib/style)
	set BIN in Makefile to the directory for the shell programs
		(usually /usr/bin)
	in the file ``style'' set L to the same directory as LIB above.
		the same is needed in ``topic'', which is installed
		when you make style
	if you wish to collect data on the documents run, also define SCATCH
		otherwise delete the definition of SCATCH in Makefile
		if you are collecting data, the file must exist and be writeable
		by everyone
E 2
	then run ``make style''
D 2
	in the file ``style'' set B to the same directory as BIN above.
E 2
I 2
		this will compile and install all of the programs in both
		LIB and BIN
E 2

``diction'' is a runcom that runs 2 programs, dprog and deroff.
D 2
	dprog has been included on the tape, but you will need to make it
	to include the full path name of dict.d
E 2

To make dprog:
	set DICT in Makefile to the full path name of diction's data
		file ``dict.d''
I 2
	the file ``diction'' also needs L set to the same directory as LIB
E 2
	the program ``dprog'' will get put in the same place as
D 2
		the object files for style (BIN).
E 2
I 2
		the object files for style (LIB).
	if you wish to collect data on the documents run, also define CATCH
		otherwise delete the definition of CATCH in Makefile
		the collection file must exist and be writeable by everyone
E 2
	then run ``make diction''
D 2
	the file ``diction'' also needs B set to the same directory as BIN
		above
E 2

D 2
The file ``explain'' needs D set to the full path name of the file
	explain.d
E 2
I 2
D 3
The file ``suggest'' needs D set to the full path name of the file
	suggest.d
E 3
I 3
The file ``explain'' needs D set to the full path name of the file
	explain.d

Both ``style'' and ``diction'' expect the document to contain formatting
	commands.  A new version of deroff is included that knows about
	the standard UNIX formatting macro packages.
D 2
	the command ``make deroff'' will install deroff in BIN mentioned
	above.  You may wish to install this version of deroff in /usr/bin
	in which case the path names to it in files ``style'' and
	``diction'' should be changed accordingly.
E 2
I 2
	the source for getopt.c is included just in case you don't have it.
	if the loader complains about not finding getopt, compile & load
		it with deroff.c
	typing
		make deroff
	will compile and install it in /usr/bin
E 2

D 2
The default flag passed to deroff (either -ms or -ml) in both

I 2
The default flag passed to deroff (either -ms or -mm) in both
E 2
	style and diction should be set to the proper one for your installation.

These programs will not compile under UNIX version 6 or PWB 1.2 due
	to size limitations on these systems.
