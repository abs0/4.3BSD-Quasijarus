4. Accuracy. 

            The errors in expm1(), log1p(), exp(), log(), cabs(), hypot()
            and cbrt() are below 1 ULP (Unit in the Last Place).

            The error in pow(x,y) grows with the size of y. Nevertheless,
            for integers x and y, pow(x,y) returns the correct integer value 
            on all tested machines (VAX, SUN, NATIONAL, ZILOG), provided that 
            x to the power of y is representable exactly.

        Some functions coded in VAX assembly language (cabs, hypot, sqrt)
        are significantly faster than the corresponding ones in 4.2BSD.
        In general, to improve performance, all functions in IEEE/support.c
        should be written in assembler and, whenever possible, should be
